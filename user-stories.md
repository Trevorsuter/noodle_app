# User Stories

## User lists index page

  When I visit a user lists index page
  I see a button or link to create a new list
  When I click that button or link
  Then I am redireted to the new user list page '/users/:id/lists/new'

  When I visit a user lists index page
  I see all of the lists created by the user and their partner
  and somewhere within each list
  I see a button to add a new task to that list
  When I click that link
  I am redirected to a page where I can create a new task for that list

  When I visit a user lists index page
  I see a button to create a new task NOT within any of the lists
  When I click on that button
  I am redirected to a page where I can create a new task
